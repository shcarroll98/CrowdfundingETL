# Crowd Funding Extraction, Transformation, and Loading

The goal of this project is to make crowdfunding data more digestible for assessing campaign success rates, identifying trends across categories or sub-categories, or developing dashboards for campaign insights.
Learning how to organize and preprocess data makes it easier to handle larger datasets, integrate with other tools, or build scalable pipelines in the future.

In this exercise, we clean, reorganize, and restructure the data. 
Exploring the dataset's schema and summary helps us understand the relational nature of the dataset.
Splitting categories and subcategories into separate tables reflects data normalization, which is critical for efficient database design.
The category and subcategory csvs contain unique ids to maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy.
